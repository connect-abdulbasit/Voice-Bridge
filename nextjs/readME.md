# Voice Bridge - WhatsApp Voice Processing System

A Next.js application that provides a webhook proxy system for processing WhatsApp messages through a voice-to-text and text-to-speech pipeline.

## üöÄ Features

- **Webhook Proxy System**: Process messages from external systems
- **Voice-to-Text**: Convert voice messages to text using UpliftAI STT
- **LLM Integration**: Process text with OpenAI GPT-4o-mini
- **Text-to-Speech**: Convert responses back to voice using UpliftAI TTS
- **WhatsApp Integration**: Basic WhatsApp bot setup (simplified for now)

## üìÅ Project Structure

```
/app
  /api
    /bot              # WhatsApp bot status and initialization
    /webhook          # Meta webhook verification
    /webhook-proxy    # Main voice processing pipeline
  /page.tsx           # Web interface for bot management
```

## üì± How to Use

### Webhook Proxy System

1. **Send a text message:**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/webhook-proxy \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "message": "Hello, how are you?",
       "type": "text",
       "openaiKey": "your-openai-key",
       "upliftKey": "your-upliftai-key"
     }'
   ```

2. **Process a voice message:**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/webhook-proxy \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "audioUrl": "https://example.com/audio.ogg",
       "type": "voice",
       "openaiKey": "your-openai-key",
       "upliftKey": "your-upliftai-key"
     }'
   ```

### WhatsApp Bot

1. **Start the bot:**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/bot
   ```

2. **Check status:**
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:3000/api/bot
   ```

3. **View web interface:**
   Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser

## üîÑ Voice Processing Pipeline

1. **Input**: Text message or audio URL
2. **Voice-to-Text**: If audio, convert to text using UpliftAI STT
3. **LLM Processing**: Send text to OpenAI GPT-4o-mini
4. **Text-to-Speech**: Convert LLM response to voice using UpliftAI TTS
5. **Output**: Return processed text and voice URL

## üéØ Use Cases

- **WhatsApp Voice Assistant**: Process voice messages and respond with voice
- **Webhook Integration**: Integrate with external systems for voice processing
- **Voice API Proxy**: Act as a middleware for voice processing services
- **Multi-platform Support**: Process messages from various sources

## üîß Configuration

The system is designed to be flexible and can be configured for different use cases:

- **LLM Provider**: Currently supports OpenAI, can be extended
- **Voice Services**: Currently supports UpliftAI, can be extended
- **Message Sources**: Supports direct API calls, webhooks, and WhatsApp

## üìù Notes

- The WhatsApp integration is currently simplified for demonstration
- The system focuses on the voice processing pipeline
- All API keys should be kept secure and not committed to version control
- The webhook proxy can be used independently of WhatsApp integration

## üöÄ Deployment

The application can be deployed to any platform that supports Next.js:

- **Vercel**: Recommended for easy deployment
- **Netlify**: Good alternative
- **Docker**: Can be containerized
- **VPS**: Traditional server deployment
